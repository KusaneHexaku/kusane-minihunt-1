    <h1>What is a Puzzlehunt?</h1>
    <p class="lead ">If you’ve never heard of puzzlehunts before, they are, essentially, a hodgepodge of information that, somehow, is hiding an answer which you must extract out. The answers are typically a word or phrase in English. Puzzles can come in many different forms; almost always with no direct instructions, so it’s up to you to figure out how to make sense of them.</p>
    <br />
    <h1>How do I play?</h1>
    <p class="lead ">Just head over to the <a href="puzzles.html
            ">Puzzles</a> page and start solving them! There are 10 feeder puzzles, and a META puzzle, making a total of 11 puzzles. The puzzles in this hunt are catered toward people who have some experience with puzzlehunts, but they should be well within the realm of beginners too!"</p>
            <p class="lead">Do note that, in this particular hunt, all the answers are an English phrase from 2 to 4 words long.</p>
            <p class="lead">You can use the Glorified Answer Checker and Hint Interface page, or GACHI for short, to check your answers and get hints from.</p>
            <br />
            <h1>What's a META puzzle?</h1>
            <p class="lead">The META puzzle, generally made to be the "final" puzzle of a hunt, is a puzzle that requires the answers from previous puzzles ("feeders") to solve. Other than that, it's about the same. Random infomations, figure out the puzzle, get an answer
                which is a word or phrase.</p>
            <br />
            <h1>I'm stuck! What do I do?</h1>
            <ul>
                <li class="lead">Double check what you have currently. Then triple check it. Being stuck due to a faulty assumption or a mistake when writing things down is a very common occurrence. </li>
                <li class="lead">Get a fresh eye to look at it. Either it be having someone else check it out, or just taking a break and coming back, can be crucial at times.</li>
                <li class="lead">Consider what information you haven't used yet. That includes everything, even the puzzle name, and the flavour text.</li>
                <li class="lead">If you happen to not know something, hit up your preferred search engine! It is not only allowed, or encouraged, but sometimes even required in order to solve a puzzle.</li>
                <li class="lead"><a href="https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/resources/haveyoutried.pdf">Have you tried...</a></li>
                <li class="lead">If you're REALLY stuck, then hit me up for a more personalised hint! Check out the <a href="@Url.Action(" About ","Home ")">About</a> page for ways to reach me, and send a message my way via your preferred method.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Are there going to be any kind of reward?</h1>
            <p class="lead">A sense pride and accomplishment, along with self-satisfaction.</p>
