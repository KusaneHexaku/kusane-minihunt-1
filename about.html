        <p class="lead ">I'm Kusane Hexaku, a puzzles and games (not just video games, but games as a concept) enthusiast. I've never done work in major hunts, though I've done a few in smaller hunts.</p>
        <p class="lead ">Some of the more real, tangible past work of mine would be the <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/cBzcObI">Concise Trickeries Compilation Mini Hunt</a> made for the Cracking the Cryptic Discord community, and a few small one-off hunts I've made as things like birthday gift or Christmas gift, and even then it's still not much.</p>
      <p class="lead">I have been writing puzzles on and off since 2016, when I first discovered <a href="http://www.puzzledpint.com/">Puzzled Pint</a> and fell in love with the world of puzzle hunts.</p>
                        <br/>
            <p class="lead ">If you wanna talk, best to do it is probably on Discord. But just in case, here are some ways you can get to me.</p>
