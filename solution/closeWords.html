<p class="lead text-primary">The puzzles strongly hints that it is themed around words that are closed or related to each other, which would suggest the idea of finding synonyms. While that is indeed part of the puzzle, that's only one half of it.</p>
        <p class="lead text-primary">The idea of "words that are close to each other" can be interpreted in a different way --- namely, words that are one letter off each other.</p>
<p class="lead text-primary">For each of the 11 given words/phrases at the bottom, there is a synonym or a word for it that is one letter away from another word that is being clued by one of the pictures. Taking the differing letters from the images' words spells out the answer.</p>

<h4>Author's Note</h4>
      
<p class="lead text-primary">Despite being placed in the second slot, this puzzle actually came quite a bit later in the creation of this hunt. And it is around this point that I've realised that this hunt so far has been dominated by word-based puzzles. This was an attempt to make an easier puzzle using some of the most common puzzle principles, which unfortunately was yet more word-based stuff, i.e. synonyms and letter changes. This should hopefully offsets some of the more involved word puzzles that would come later (e.g. Encryptic).</p>
