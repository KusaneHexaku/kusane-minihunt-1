 <p class="lead text-primary">The puzzles gives nine seemingly unrelated phrases. The title of the puzzle, "Alright, Proceed.", is a hint for the band <strong>OK GO</strong>. Additonally, the flavour text is made up of three different OK GO song titles ("<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTAAsCNK7RA">Here It Goes Again</a>","<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwpCb0qW-6Y">Don't Ask Me</a>", and "Do What You Want", which has two different music videos so I'm going to link them both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9MFpXDqpZI">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i00GDT9FuFM">here</a>.</p>      
<p class="lead text-primary">We can look up these nine phrases, and sure enough they are all lines from an OK GO song.</p>
<p class="lead text-primary">While it is specified that the redacted words are not involved in the extraction steps, the number of █s in each instances of the redaction matches the number of letters in the redacted word.</p>

<p class="lead text-primary">Here we notice a couple things :</p>
<p class="lead text-primary">- The lyrics all appears at different times into their songs, but overall relatively early.</p>
<p class="lead text-primary">- The given lines appears only once in each of their song.</p>
<br><p class="lead text-primary">So, we can find how many lines into the song do they appear at, then use that position to index into the song titles.</p>

<h4>Author's Note</h4>
      
  <p class="lead text-primary">The choice to redacted some of the words was a weird one. Some of them were necessary (i.e. in the case of Skyscraper's line, because it contains the song's name), while others were just results of experimenting with how easy to get the correct result to pop up from copy and pasting it into a search engine. It's not the most elegant way to deal with it, but it's something. Plus, redacting out the swear word was a funny and cute idea.</p>
