<p class="lead text-primary">The puzzle presents itself as a series of equations (with the exceptions of the first two). Within the equations, there are ten square brackets labeled 1-10 accordingly, which matches the number of feeder puzzles we have. This suggests that the answer phrases each refer to a number that can be substituted into the equations.</p>

<h4>Author's Note</h4>
      
  <p class="lead text-primary">Because I was working with such a tight time restriction, the META I came up with ended up being pretty simple, and arguably a bit anticlimatic comparing to some of the feeders. However, now that the time was no longer a problem, after debating whether I should rewrite it or not, I decided that I would rather keep a simple META, than try to rewrite it and potentially rendering all the works I've done prior useless. Oh well, I hope you had fun with the main puzzles at least.</p>
