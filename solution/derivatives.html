 <p class="lead text-primary ">Each of the clues given can be associated with a word. At some point, you may have noticed that some of the clues shares the same word. In fact, the clues can be divided into six groups of three clues each based on the word they're associated with.</p>                                                           
 <p class="lead text-primary ">The six groups are: Velocity, Acceleration, Jerk, Snap, Crackle, and Pop. These are all Physics terms to do with motion. More specifically, each one is a derivative of Position with respect to time at different levels, i.e. Velocity is the derivative of Position, Acceleration is the derivative of Velocity, Jerk is the derivative of Acceleration, Snap is the derivative of Jerk, Crackle is the derivative of Snap, and Pop is the derivative of Crackle.</p>
 <p class="lead text-primary ">Ordering the group starting from Velocity, then ordering the three clues in each groups alphabetically (based on the clue itself and not the letters in the square bracket) gives an ordering to all the clues, and spells the answer with the letters in the square bracket.</p>
